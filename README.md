Perspective
===========

WildStar addon to track and display units on the user's screen.

Perspective was inspirated by the Ayth Quest and EntSpy addons.  I loved what the addons did but always felt they lacked the degree of customization that I demand.

This is a work in progress, some settings such as the markers and blacklist have not been added to the configuration screen yet.
